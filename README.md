# Music Gen

This project aims to train Convolutional AutoEncoder(s) based on various types of music. The decoder will then be used to generate music from the latent features.

## Feature Structure

Notes:

- I add a feature for "modernness" to the latent representation, which is not encoded but should assist the decoder.
